## Master Volume for Music
So we can lower volume and give voice message

## Another Player to play voice messages
Main Component can play a file

## Multiple set lists

setlist ==> SongList[]

Currently, we are displaying 1 set list essentailly, but we should have a parent component that allows us to choose a set list which would bascially
just choose which onDeck to start with.

We can AI generate an onDeck playlist for Ceremory, Dinner Music and Dance,

We create three setlists and can choose which one to load up

This should be based on files. this way we place files ina  folder and it the program knows to create that many setlists.
These will be seachable list.

List will essentailly be a list of lists to manage the same way we are managing the single list.

# Add feature to songListSearchable
- allow for "add all" to onDeck list.
